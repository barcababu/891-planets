Even though short and small, Pluto makes up for this by being icy cold to his neighboring planets. Pluto is also nelgected by its creator, the sun. PLuto was actually kicked out by its neighboring planets being deemed a "Dwarf Planet". This angered Pluto, causing pluto to collect asteroids and unleash meteor 
showers all over the solar system. This of course has not effect on its creator the sun. Pluto is 
actually a cousin to Neptuneyy. Despite Neptuneyy's kindness towards Pluto, Pluto still acts like a
jerk. Neptuneyy is the only planet that stands up for Pluto.
