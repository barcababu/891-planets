Larger and closer moon of Mars. 

Discovered in 1877. 

It's the closest orbiting moon known to man- so close that it orbits Mars faster than Mars rotates- completes orbit in 7 hours and 39 minutes

Has a large impact crater, Stickney. 

"Phobos" comes from the greek personification of Horror. 

Phobos is drawing closer to Mars by one meter every century. 

It is predicted that in 50 million years it will collide with the planet or break up into a planetary ring. 

	A planetary ring is a disk of dust, moonlets and small objects orbiting a planet.
